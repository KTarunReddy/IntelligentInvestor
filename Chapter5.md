# The Intelligent Investor: Chapter 5 
The Defensive Investor and Common Stocks

## Chapter
1. 2 points highlighting the benefit of Common Stocks
   1. Stocks offer a considerable degree of protection against the erosion of the value of a dollar via inflation.
   2. Higher average return to the investor over the years. This was produced both by an average dividend income exceeding the yield on good bonds and by an underlying tendency for market value to increase over the years in consequence of reinvestment of undistributed profits.
2. While these 2 points have been of great importance and historically the returns obtained on stocks has far succeeded that of bonds in the long term, these benefits will be lost if the investor pays too high of a price for his shares. 
3. Dividends and their reinvestments are the greatest force in stock investing.
4. High prices in stocks lose the value of dividend yields over bond interest rates. 
5. The defensive investor cannot afford to be without an appreciable proportion of common stocks even if he must regard them as the lesser of two evils - the greater being the risk of an all bond holding portfolio.
6. __Rules for Common-Stock Component For the Defensive Investor__
   1. There should be adequate, not excessive diversification. Min 10 and Max 30 stock names.
   2. Each company selected should be large, prominent and conservatively financed.
   3. Each company should have continuous dividend payments. The rule of thumb here is that there should be 10 years of uninterrupted dividend payments (MSFT didn't follow this); even 20 years should be considered not overtly conservative.
   4. The investor should impose some restriction on the price they will pay on the issue in relation to its average earnings over 7 years. 
      1. Limit should be set at 25x average earnings.
      2. Not more than 20x average earnings over the last twelve month period.
      3. This will prove to remove all growth stocks from the mix. 
7. __Growth Stock and the Defensive Investor__
   1. __Growth Stock__: Stock that has increased in its per-share earnings in the past at well above the rate for common stocks generally and is expected to continue to do so in the future. 
      1. Some authorities say, Growth Stocks double their earnings within 10 years.
      2. __The Rule of 72__: To estimate the time an amount of money takes to double, simply divide its assumed growth into 72. At 7.1%, a growth stock, using the Rule of 72 will double its growth slightly over 10 years. 
   2. The hotter they are, the harder they fall.
   3. Growth stocks are considered too uncertain and risky a vehicle for a defensive investor.
   4. Earnings Multiplier = P/E Ratio: how much an investor is willing to pay for the stock compared to the profitability of the underlying business.
8. __Portfolio Changes__
   1. The defensive intelligent investor should obtain, once a year, advice regarding changes in the portfolio.
      1. It is essential they ask only the most trusted firms.
9. __Dollar Cost Averaging__
   1.  No one has yet to discover any other formula in investing which can be used with so much confidence of ultimate success, regardless of what may happen to security prices.
10. __The Investor's Personal Situation__
    1.  The kind of securities purchased and the rate of return to be sought depend not on the investor's financial resources but on his financial equipment in terms of knowledge, experience and temperament. 
11. __Notes on the Concept of Risk__
    1. To reduce ambiguity, the concept of risk is applied solely to the loss of value which is realized through loss of sale or significant deterioration in the company's position or the payment of the excessive price in relation with the intrinsic value of the security. 
    2. A common stock shouldn't be considered risky because of price fluctuation. 
12. __Notes on the category of "Large, Prominent and Conservatively Financed Corporations__
    1.  The words "Large" and "Prominent" carry the notion of substantial size combined with leading position in the industry. 
        1.  Large - $10B market cap
        2.  Prominent - in the top 1/4 or 1/3 of an industry group
    2. Defensive investor can define their own meaning of "Large" and "Prominent".

## Commentary
1. How defensive an investment should be depends less on your tolerance for risk than the time and effort you are willing to put into your portfolio.
