# The Intelligent Investor: Chapter 4 
General Portfolio Policy: The Defensive Investor

## Chapter
1. It has been an old and sound principle that those who cannot afford to take risks should be content with a relatively low return on their investment funds. 
   1. The rate of return the investor can aim for is directly proportional to the risk they can take.
2. For the intelligent investor, however, the rate of return should only be dependent on the amount of intelligent effort they are willing and able to bear on his task.
3. The suggestion for a defensive investor's portfolio is a combination of high grade bonds and high grade stocks of a 25% - 75% range. 
   1. The advice, therefore, can boil down to 50-50 stock-bonds for the defensive investor to offset any risk but give a steady return. 
4. __Bond Component__
   1. Two questions:
      1. Should the bonds be tax-free or taxable?
         1. There is evidence that a large proportion of investors will gain higher rates of return after municipal bonds than corporate bonds.
      2. Should the maturities be long term or short term?
         1. This question boils down to:
            1. Does the investor want to assure himself against a decline in the price of bonds at a cost of:
               1. Lower annual yield
               2. Loss of possible appreciable gain in principal value.
   2. Different types of bonds
      1. US Saving Bonds
      2. Other US Bonds
      3. Municipal and State Bonds
      4. Corporate Bonds
         1. High Yielding Bonds
         2. Saving Deposits in Lieu of Bonds
         3. Convertible Issues
         4. Call Provisions
5. __Other Stock Components__
   1. Preferred Stock
   2. Security Forms

## Commentary
1. There are two ways to become an intelligent investor:
   1. __Defensive / Passive__: Creating a permanent portfolio that runs on autopilot and requires no further effort (but generates very little excitement).
   2. __Active / Aggressive__: Continually researching, selecting and monitoring a dynamic mix of stocks, bonds, or mutual funds.
2. The active approach is physically and mentally taxing while the defensive approach is emotionally demanding and requires ascetic detachment. 
3. Both approaches are equally intelligent and you can be successful with either but if you know yourself well enough, stick with one method throughout the course of your investment lifetime.
   1. If you are highly competitive, think like a sports fan and relish an intellectual challenge choose Aggressive Investing.
   2. If you always feel rushed, crave similarity and don't relish thinking about money choose Defensive Investing.
4. Age has nothing to do with investments i.e. your allocation of portfolios shouldn't be a function of age going against conventional wisdom that you should invest according to your age. 
5. Traditional Rule of thumb is subtract your age from 100 and that'll be your allocation in stocks and rest in bonds or cash.
6. Because so many investors have the guts to cling on to stocks in a falling market, Graham insists that everyone should keep a minimum of 25% in bonds. 
7. Rebalacing your portfolio between bonds and stock allocations must be done in a patient and predictable schedule; the suggestion is once every 6 months on set days like 4th of July and New Years.
